Password-Generator
Introduction
This application generates a random password based on criteria that the user sets themselves. The user must choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. They may choose at least one, and up to any, of the following character sets to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

This project taught me a lot about working with JavaScript, and understanding the logic behind it. I learned about working with user input, objects, functions, conditionals, and how to put them all together in a real world application.
